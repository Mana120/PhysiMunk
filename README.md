# PhysiMunk: Physics Made Fun and Visual

This project is designed to make physics more engaging and enjoyable for students by focusing on key topics such as projectile motion and collisions. We achieve this through the use of Pymunk, a physics engine that allows us to create various simulated environments.

Imagine a scenario where students can actively participate in learning physics. They are presented with different parameters they can modify, such as the mass of objects, initial velocities, and angles. These adjustments influence the outcome of the physics simulations, turning abstract concepts into tangible, interactive experiences.

Through these simulations, students can visualize and experiment with how changes in these parameters affect the behavior of objects in motion. For example, they can observe how altering the mass of a projectile affects its trajectory in a projectile motion simulation. They can also explore how different variables impact the outcome of collisions between objects.

The goal of this project is to make physics more accessible and fun. By providing students with a hands-on, visual way to explore these fundamental physics principles, we aim to enhance their understanding and engagement with the subject. Learning becomes an exciting adventure as students actively participate in creating and observing the physics of the virtual world, ultimately making the study of physics a more enjoyable and comprehensible experience.
